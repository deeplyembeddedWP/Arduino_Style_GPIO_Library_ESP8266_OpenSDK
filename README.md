# Arduino_Style_GPIO_Library_ESP8266_OpenSDK

This is a GPIO Library that is compatible to be used with the ESP8266 OpenSDK on Linux. The GPIO API's has been ported from the ESP8266 Arduino Core Libraries to work with the ESP8266 OpenSDK. This simplifies the approach to using the GPIO's for those who are building projects using the OpenSDK and gives the liberty to avoid using the GPIO API's present in the OpenSDK/official SDK, while attaining the same functionalities.

The description of the helper Library presented here is on the website: http://deeplyembedded.org/gpio-library-esp8266-opensdk/

Demo video for the working of this Library are retrieved from https://youtu.be/zHyllmNURUc
